# 🚀 Prompt Playbook

Welcome to **Prompt Playbook** — my personal collection of high-impact prompts that help me think faster, write sharper, and ship better as a Product Manager.

These are the *real prompts* I use every day for:

- PRDs  
- Strategy & 1-pagers  
- Discovery & interviews

Each prompt includes **why it works**, so you don’t just copy it — you learn the pattern.
